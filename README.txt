To update RFID's, you update the matTable.csv file.

The row data is: 1. name, 2. RFID, 3. video file
The name column is for your use only, the program ignores it. It can have extra spaces for alignment if you want.
The other columns should NOT have any spaces.

A row of data should like this:
aluminum,ED0341800000000000,vid00001.mpg
